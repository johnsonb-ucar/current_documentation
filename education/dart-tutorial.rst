The `DART Tutorial <https://dart.ucar.edu/pages/Tutorial.html>`_ outlines a
step-by-step approach to the concepts of ensemble data assimilation. A set of
26 PDF files guides the user through a mathematical introduction to Data
Assimilation and Ensemble Kalman Filter concepts. If youâ€™ve been able to build
the Lorenz 63 model, you have correctly configured your ``mkmf.template`` and
you are now able to run all of the programs required by the tutorial.
