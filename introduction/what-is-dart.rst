What is DART?
#############

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is an open-source, freely
available community facility for ensemble data assimilation (DA)
developed and maintained by the `Data Assimilation Research Section
(DAReS) <https://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/>`_ at the `National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) <https://ncar.ucar.edu>`_.

DART provides modelers, observational scientists, and geophysicists with
powerful, flexible DA tools that are easy to use and can be customized to
support efficient and reliable DA applications. DART is primarily oriented for
DA research but has also been used in operational settings. DART is a
software environment that makes it easy to explore a variety of data
assimilation methods and observations with different numerical models
and is designed to facilitate the combination of assimilation
algorithms, models, and real (as well as synthetic) observations to
allow increased understanding of all three. DART includes extensive
documentation, a comprehensive tutorial, and a variety of models and
observation sets that can be used to introduce new users or graduate
students to ensemble DA. DART also provides a framework for developing,
testing, and distributing advances in ensemble DA to a broad community
of users by removing the implementation-specific peculiarities of
one-off DA systems.

DART is intended for use by DA beginners as well as experts, students as
well as teachers, national labs and centers as well as university
research labs, and everything in between; thus, different users may have
different goals in "getting started."
