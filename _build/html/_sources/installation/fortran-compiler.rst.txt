Fortran90 Compiler
##################

The DART software is written in standard Fortran 90, with no
compiler-specific extensions. It has been compiled and run with several
versions of each of the following: \* `GNU Fortran Compiler
(“gfortran”) <http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran>`__ (free) \* `Intel Fortran
Compiler for Linux and
OSX <http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-composer-xe>`__ \* `IBM XL
Fortran Compiler <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/fortran/>`__
\* `Portland Group Fortran Compiler <http://www.pgroup.com/>`__ \*
`Lahey Fortran Compiler <http://www.lahey.com/>`__ \* `NAG Fortran
compiler <https://www.nag.com/nag-compiler>`__ \* `PathScale Fortran
compiler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PathScale>`__

Since recompiling the code is a necessity to experiment with different
models, there are no DART binaries to distribute. If you are unfamiliar
with Fortran and/or wonder why we would choose this language, see Why
Fortran? for more information.
