Downloading DART
################

The DART source code is distributed on the GitHub repository
`NCAR/DART <https://github.com/NCAR/DART>`__ with the documentation
served through GitHub Pages at http://dart.ucar.edu.

Go to https://github.com/NCAR/DART and clone the repository or get the
ZIP file according to your preference. See the `github help page on
cloning <https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`__
for more information on how to clone a repository. Take note of the
directory you installed into, which is referred to as *DARTHOME* below.

.. note:: If you are interested in contributing to DART, see How can I
          contribute to DART? for more information. In short, you will need to
          be familiar with the `GitHub workflow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`__.

Unzip or clone the distribution in your desired directory, which we
refer to as “DARTHOME” in this document. Compiling the code in this tree
(as is usually the case) may require a large amount of additional disk
space (up to the 1 Gb required for DART), so be aware of any disk quota
restrictions before continuing.
